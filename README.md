 ## Project Tetra
 # A 4-Color RPG experience

 This is a project, where I develop a space themed 2D RPG with a changable palette of only 4 colors.

It is available as a Linux and as a Windows version.

***Warning! Windows version has worse performance! I'd advise using the Linux version, if you can.***
